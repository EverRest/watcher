## Batch 4 — Laravel + CLI (closed)

| ID | Item | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| H2 | Laravel `watcher` config with sibling `fleet` breaks `Watcher::fromConfig` / `Factory::doctor` | closed |
| M1 | CLI and `watcher:run`: catch `Throwable` at process boundary (class + message, exit 1) | closed |
| M2 | `AnalyzerFailed` handler: state snapshot/write must not mask the analysis error | closed |

## Batch 5 — Code links + Loki text filter (closed)

| ID | Item | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| W6 | `CodeLinkBuilder::mapPath` prefix match without path-segment boundary (`/app` vs `/apple`) | closed |
| H5 | Loki text-mode line filter drops stack-trace continuations server-side | closed (continuations); unworded labelled main lines still use `level_mode: label` |
